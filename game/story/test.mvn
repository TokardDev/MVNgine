@You glance around, the dense forest swallowing the last bits of sunlight.

[+ Copper skeptical]
>Copper  
You say that now, but every scary story starts exactly like this.  
[Copper arms_crossed]  
Why are we even doing this again?  

[+ radikal smirk]
>Bowden  
Because I’m not backing down from a dare.  
[radikal mv 15]

>Copper  
Yeah, well, now I’m regretting that decision.  
[Copper mv 10]  
Why does it feel like we’re being watched?  

[+ Bowden serious]
>Bowden  
You’re imagining things... probably.  
[Bowden look ahead]

@A sudden noise echoes through the trees, and you both freeze.

[+ Copper alarmed]
>Copper  
Okay, what  [i]was[/i] that?  

[+ Bowden uneasy]
>Bowden

@But in the back of your mind, you both know it wasn’t.
