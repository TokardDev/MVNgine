[bg forest]  
@The dense forest hums with the sound of insects, leaves rustling in the wind. The path ahead is barely visible under the dim light.

Alright, remind me again why we’re out here?  

[+ cameron annoyed -20]  
>Cameron  
Because we’re looking for something interesting.  

[+ devon confused 20]  
>Devon  
Yeah, and "interesting" is usually code for "dumb and dangerous."

Bro. [b]Adventure.[/b] Mystery. The unknown. You gotta [i]embrace[/i] the chaos.  

>Copper  
I’d rather embrace a warm blanket and a burger, but sure.  

>Devon  
What exactly are we even looking for?  

>Cameron  
Rumor has it, deep in this forest, there’s an ancient altar. No one knows what it was for.  

>Radikal  
Sick. Maybe we summon something. Get a little eldritch horror action goin’ on.  

>Copper  
Or we [b]don’t.[/b]  

@The trees thin out as the group steps into a clearing. In the center stands a massive stone slab, covered in moss and strange carvings.

>Cameron  
This must be it.  

>Devon  
…Okay, yeah, this place is cursed. I can feel it.  

>Radikal  
Bro. I got a plan.  

>Copper  
Oh no.  

>Radikal  
I’m gonna stand on it.  

>Cameron  
That is the worst idea I’ve ever heard.  

>Radikal  
[b]AND YET.[/b]  

@Before anyone can stop him, Radikal jumps onto the slab. The air shifts, the temperature dropping instantly. A deep, guttural sound rumbles beneath their feet.  

>Devon  
DUDE. WHAT DID YOU DO?!  

>Radikal  
Hell yeah, something’s happening.  

>Copper  
This is the exact plot of every horror movie where people die first.  

@The carvings glow, faintly pulsing like a heartbeat. The ground trembles.  

>Cameron  
We need to [b]leave.[/b]  

>Radikal  
Or—hear me out—we see what happens next.  

>Devon  
I SWEAR TO GOD, RADIKAL.  

@The pulsing stops. Silence.  

>Copper  
…Did we break it?  

@A distant howl echoes through the trees. The sky darkens unnaturally fast. The air is thick with something unseen.  

>Radikal  
…Okay, yeah, we should probably go.  

>Cameron  
[b]NOW.[/b]  

@The group sprints back into the woods, the howling growing louder, closer. The trees feel like they’re closing in, the path twisting, unfamiliar.  

[bg mountain]  
@They emerge on a rocky ledge, looking back. The forest is still. Quiet. Nothing follows.  

>Devon  
Never. Again.  

>Radikal  
…But what if—  

>Copper  
[b]NO.[/b]  

@The wind picks up, carrying a whisper. Something deep in the forest… watching.
