>Copper  
Yo, this place is sketchy as hell. Why we here again?  

[+ radikal radikal 50]  
>Radikal  
Because adventure, bro. Live a little.  

[+ devon confused 20]  
>Devon  
You mean "die a little," because this place looks like it’s about to collapse.  

[+ cameron annoyed -15]  
>Cameron  
It’s historical. You guys have no appreciation for history.  

>Copper  
History’s great and all, but like… what if there’s something still [i]living[/i] here?  

>Radikal  
Bro, if a ghost wants to square up, I got hands.  

>Devon  
You can't fight a ghost, dumbass.  

@A sudden gust of wind rushes through the ruins, carrying a whisper-like sound.  

>Copper  
Nah. Nope. Hate that.  

>Cameron  
It’s just the wind.  

>Radikal  
Or it’s [b]destiny[/b].  

[bg forest]  
@The group walks deeper into the ruins, entering a dense forest at its edge. The air is thick, almost unnatural.  

>Devon  
I swear if we get lost, I’m blaming Cameron.  

>Cameron  
We’re [i]not[/i] lost. There’s a path.  

>Radikal  
Bro, this is literally just dirt and grass.  

>Copper  
Yeah, I think that’s called “the ground,” Cameron.  

@Something moves in the bushes ahead.  

>Devon  
Okay, that was definitely not the wind.  

>Cameron  
Stay calm. It could just be an animal.  

>Copper  
Yeah, or something that wants to eat us.  

@A shadow flickers between the trees, just out of sight.  

>Radikal  
Ayo, who there?  

@Silence. Then, a whisper—almost a voice—echoing through the trees.  

[bg big_ruins]  
@The group follows the sound, climbing up towards a clearing overlooking the ruins below. The sky is darkening, the air colder.  

>Cameron  
Something about this place… it feels [i]wrong[/i].  

>Copper  
You’re just figuring that out now?  

>Devon  
We should go back.  

@The whispering stops.  

>Radikal  
Yo, what if we just—  

@A loud snap behind them. A branch breaking.  

[+ devon confused 10]  
>Devon  
NOPE. I’M OUT.  

>Copper  
[b]SAME.[/b]  

@The group runs, crashing through the underbrush, back towards the ruins. The whispers return, now surrounding them, an eerie chant just beyond understanding.  

[bg ruins]  
@They burst back into the ruins, panting. The air is still. The whispering gone.  

>Cameron  
…Did we imagine that?  

>Radikal  
Yeah nah, that was some real [b]paranormal activity[/b] shit.  

>Copper  
I vote we never talk about this again.  

>Devon  
Seconded.  

>Cameron  
…but don’t you [i]want[/i] to know what it was?  

>Radikal  
Cameron, I swear to god, if you say we should go back—  

@A distant whisper echoes one last time.  

>Copper  
…Time to go.
