Hey, it's been a while since we walked together like this.  
[Bowden mv 15]  
[Bowden look right]  
Look at that... the city lights are beautiful tonight, don't you think?  

@You nod, feeling a slight chill in the air.

You seem distracted. Is everything okay?  

@You hesitate, then decide to speak your mind.
>Copper
Uh yeah, sorry, I was thinking.
>Bowden
Are you alright ?
